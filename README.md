# Quantum vs Classical Random Walk Simulation

This repository contains Python code and simulation results comparing quantum walk and classical random walk dynamics on a 1D lattice.

## 📁 Contents
- `QuantumWalkVSRandomWalk.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation
- `quantum_walk_animation.gif`: Animated evolution of the quantum walk
- `quantum_walk_final_distribution.png`: Final probability distribution after 50 steps

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the notebook using Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. Animation is generated using `matplotlib.animation`. The key cell is labeled `# Quantum Walk Animation`.

## 🔍 Features
- Implements 1D discrete-time quantum walk using Hadamard coin
- Compares with classical random walk on the same lattice
- Visualizes the difference in diffusion speed and final distribution shape
- Animation illustrates interference patterns unique to quantum walks
